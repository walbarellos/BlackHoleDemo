✅ Detection of matter being swallowed with:

Particle trails
Spaghettification - visual stretching as particles approach
Progressive fading when crossing the horizon
Real-time statistics

✅ Dynamic visual effects:

Particles change according to mass, spin, and charge
Visible frame-dragging on Kerr
Flattened and bright ergosphere
Calculated accretion rate

✅ Functional controls:

Mass alters black hole size
Spin creates ergosphere and accelerates orbits
Charge modifies horizons
Adjustable particle spawn rate
